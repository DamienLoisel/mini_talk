# minitalk

## Description

The **minitalk** project at 42 involves creating a simple messaging system using signals in C. The goal is to develop a client-server application where the client can send messages to the server. The server will receive and decode the messages sent by the client using UNIX signals.

## Features

- **Signal Communication**: Use UNIX signals to send and receive messages between the client and server.
- **Message Handling**: Implement a mechanism for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Client and Server**: Develop both a client and server program where the client sends messages and the server processes them.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for signal reception and message processing.
